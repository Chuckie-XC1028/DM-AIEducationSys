# DM Awesome AI Educational System Papers

To benefit research  AI Educational System, I organize papers about Educational published at top conferences and Journals. Our repository has included the following:

- **COnferences**
  - `ML`: `NIPS`
  - `AI`: `AAAI`, `IJCAI`.
  - `Information Retrieval`: `SIGIR`, `KDD`
- **JOunrnals**
  - `WIC`, `KBS`

But it's not limited to this.

#### What's new(Save the Latest 5 records!):

- 2023/7/26: We add two papers from `2022KDD` and `2022KBS`. We also make a new structure for the format.
- 2023/4/24 We add two papers from `NIPS'15` and `WIC'19`.
